# Ripple Currency Exchange-Rate Tool (CXR) #

This is a simple little web-app that gets the current exchange rates from the [Ripple Data API v2](https://ripple.com/build/data-api-v2/) and demonstrates the call-and-response.

It uses jQuery.

See the [live demo on GitHub Pages](https://mduo13.github.io/ripple-currency-exchange-rate-tool/).
